This is my second attempt on House Price Prediction model where I tried out half of the 80 features into the Linear Regression model with a hope that it would improve my earlier 81% where I just tried out 5 features. This time the accuracy increased to 84 % encouraging me to go for a full fledged data cleanup and using correlation technique later on. Putting this on record which was the stepping stone for my next improvised model
